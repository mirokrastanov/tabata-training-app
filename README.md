| `GET`  |         TODO          |           TODO from here on            |

| `GET`  |          `/`          |                  home                  |

### Discord Login (via OAuth2) - How it works
1. Send a `GET` request to `/discord/login`. 
2. It redirects you to Discord for Authorization.
3. Authorize and you are redirected to `/discord/redirect` and a **Query Parameter** is attached. Example: `/discord/redirect?code=AuthorizationStringHere`
4. You are logged in and receive a user JSON object. `{ user: {...}, session: {...} }`
___
- If you deny Authorization you are NOT logged in and you receive a JSON object with information and `{ user: null, errors: {...} }`.
